# CMSC423: Fall 2024 Project6 Sample Data

The directory `test_input` contains two separate tests; each a pair of a genome and a set of simulated reads.  The `omicron` genome and read set is small (~1000 reads) while the `megavirus` genome and read set is larger (~10000 reads).

The directory `test_output` contains reference output in the `picomap` format described in the project spec.

**Note**: Both test datasets were aligned with a mismatch penalty of -3 and a gap penalty of -5.
